The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league, contested by generally eight teams (10 in IPL 2022) which represent different Indian cities/states.IPL holds great value in the billion-dollar cricket industry and hence the selection of team plays a crucial role in winning the league.

In IPL, a team can acquire players through any of the three ways:
• The annual player auction
• Signing replacements for unavailable players.
• Trading players with other teams during the trading windows

The aim of the project is to identify and predict the value of some IPL bowlers, through data analysis. The data has been presented in various pictographical forms with the help of data visualization. Varoius tests have been performed through hypothesis testing., and machine learning (ML) concepts have been used to predict the value of IPL bowlers. This prediction will improve the team selection as well as the budget management for various teams.
